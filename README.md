# [large-type.com](http://large-type.com) ‚Äì Display and share messages in VERY LARGE TEXT from your browser

![](twitter-card.png)

Large-type.com let's you display messages in very large text directly from your browser. Whoa!

That's handy whenever you need to read something on your screen from further away‚Äîfor example, a phone number. Nice!

Even better, when you share text with large-type.com only the person with the link sees your text. Rendering happens locally on your browser and your text is not transmitted to any servers.

### Is this secure?
Per [RFC 2396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2396#section-4) browsers [don't send the URL fragment with the HTTP request](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/317760/how-to-get-url-hash-from-server-side). Thus sharing a link to large-type.com won't leak your secret word.

Large-type.com is open-source, very small and hosted on GitHub Pages which means you can audit the source code to see that your data isn't sent or stored anywhere else.
